In this part, it's also using HashMap and checking correctly.
But the problem is it's making the visited attribute of Employee true when it is already found.
After that in the equals method, it checks checking visited attribute. It's incorrect.
The solution is removing the visited attribute in the equals method.
And there is another new thing in the hashCode method. It shows different syntax. It's correct too.
