The method removeDuplicates creates a new list(noDupsList) and stores unique data there.
First, this list is null then added first value of the employee list.
Then looping the rest of all values of the employee with checking value exists in noDupsList.
When checking existing it is using the inList method.
In this method, it is checked with the equals method of the Employee class.
The problem is the equals method of the Employee class.
This equals method does not override the Object's method.
It is getting the Employee object in the parameter. That is incorrect.
After the change of equals method, the result becomes correct.
